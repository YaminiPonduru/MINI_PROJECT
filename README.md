# Human-Computer Interaction with Hand Gesture Recognition and Voice Commands

This project enables interaction with computers using hand gestures and voice commands. It employs hand gesture recognition via OpenCV and MediaPipe, and integrates voice command functionality using speech-to-text processing, allowing control over system operations such as adjusting volume, launching apps, and more.

## Key Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Real-time tracking and recognition of hand gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Voice Commands**: Execute system tasks like volume control, app launch, and web searches using speech recognition.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run hand gesture tracking: `python hand_try.py`
3. Run voice command system: `python voice_control_update.py`
4. Combine both for full interaction: `python interface.py`
